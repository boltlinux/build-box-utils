Description: utilities for managing Bolt OS build roots
 Build Box NG is a collection of tools for bootstrapping and working with Bolt
 OS build roots. It allows you to enter target root file systems and
 cross-compile software packages directly without having to worry about the
 usual intricacies of cross-compliation.
 .
 This is achieved through a trick by which parts of the environment are emulated
 with QEMU, while other parts, such as the compiler and tools (GCC, Make, Perl,
 Python, Tcl, ...), run at native speed.
